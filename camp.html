            <h4>Tell Me About Summer Camp!</h4>
            <p>Every year, kids from all over Michigan converge to meet for the annual River of God, Diamonds in the Rough Kid's Summer Camp. United in Christ Ministries, in cooperation with Diamonds in the Rough, usually send around 40 &ndash; 50 inner city youth to camp primarily from the Black Hills Neighborhood. Camp is an amazing time of worship, fun, friends, and more fun! For many of us, it is the most amazing time of the year, and for many of the kids it is the ONLY time of the year. In today's society where there are so many broken homes, camp provides an atmosphere of love and acceptance and good clean fun. It has been a life changing experience for most kids who come. For some children, this is the only vacation they will get. We won't turn kids away who don't have the money, so we are always looking for creative ways to raise funds for scholarships. We would love to count on your support. For more information, read on&hellip;</p>
            <h4>What is the Purpose of Camp?</h4>
            <p>First and foremost, camp should provide an opportunity for our children to experience and touch God for themselves. In Matthew 19:14 Jesus said, &ldquo;Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the Kingdom of Heaven belongs to such as these.&rdquo; Camp provides the environment for the Holy Spirit to breathe life into the Word that has been planted in their hearts.</p>
            <p>Secondly, camp should provide an environment of love and acceptance from counselors, staff, and peers, and be FUN! Children need to know that it is fun and exciting to be a Christian, and they need to know that even when they are young and immature and don't always do the right thing, they are still loved and accepted by God.</p>
            <h4>Who, When, & Where, and How Much?</h4>
            <p>Camp is open to everyone! Elementary Kids (Grades entering 3rd &ndash; 6th) will go to camp June 13-17, and the cost per student is $250.00. Junior High Kids (Grades entering 7th &ndash; 9th) will go to camp June 20-24, and the cost per student is $275.00. Camp is traditionally held on the awesome grounds of Pine Trail Camp in Saugatuck, Michigan. Pine trail provides close access to Lake Michigan, The Muskegon River, Sand Dunes, and much, much more. Camp is an amazing experience, and we encourage you to consider sending your own children, or mention it to friends and family who wish for their kids to have a God-filled fun, safe summer camp experience. If cost is an issue, there is always a way. It is our policy to NEVER turn anyone away because of finances.Please contact us for opportunities to have your child sponsored to go to camp. United in Christ, along with Diamonds in the Rough and River of God church, send 40 &ndash; 50 youth from the inner-city neighborhood of the Black Hills every year.</p>
            <h4>Is Camp Fun? What Activities are Offered?</h4>
            <p>Is camp fun? Silly question! Camp is the most fun week of the year for most of the kids that attend. Camp is full of fun activities, old and new friends, friendly loving counselors, caring staff, amazing food, and did we mention fun? Kids will spend daily time at Chapel, where they will participate in fun and engaging worship. Three healthy, nourishing meals are provided at the cafeteria, where children will perform scripture memory skits for accolades and prizes. Their days will be full of regular activities such as canoeing, marksmanship, zipline, art, drama, and music. Plus there are additional special activities through the week such as dune rides, beach day at Lake Michigan, and fun camp games. The kids are always busy having fun, buidling relationships, and most importantly, enjoying the presence of God.</p>

            <h4>Silent Auction</h4>
            <p>During the Carrabba's Dinner, we will also be having a Silent Auction. Local and Area Businesses graciously and generously donate some amazing goods and services that will be available for our Dinner guests to bid on. Grab a weekend getaway, gift certificates, and much, much more&hellip; usually at great prices! We are always looking for donors to sponsor items for our Silent Auction, so please consider donating or approaching your favorite local businesses to help out. Again, it is for the kids that could not otherwise get to camp. In return, you will get a great meal and the opportunity to bid on some amazing Silent Auction items!</p>
            <h4>Spread The Word</h4>
            <p>As we said before, everyone is welcome at Camp. One of the best ways you can help is by word of mouth. Let others know about this amazing opportunity to send their kids, volunteer to help, or sponsor a child to go to camp by making a donation or participating in our Carrabba's Dinner and Silent Auction. We count on generous supporters such as yourself to make camp an amazing and successful experience. Camp has been split into two weeks this year, so we have room for more kids, need more volunteers, and will need more finances. Camp is an expensive endeavor, so we need your help.</p>
